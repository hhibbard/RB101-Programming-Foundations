File::path
File.path(path) -> string
# class method
# returhs the string representation of the path

File#path
path -> filename
to_path -> filename
# instance method
# returns the pathname used to create file as a string
# pathname may not point to the file corresponding to file
# pathname becomes void when the file has been moved or deleted


Found both of these in the File class documentation
Class methods are called on the class, instance methods are called on objects
